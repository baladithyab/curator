## Online Processing

Online processing in AWS Bedrock refers to real-time, synchronous API calls to foundation models for generating responses to individual prompts.

### Supported Models and Regions

AWS Bedrock is available in multiple regions, with each region supporting different models. The primary regions include:

| Region Name | Region Code |
|-------------|-------------|
| US East (N. Virginia) | us-east-1 |
| US East (Ohio) | us-east-2 |
| US West (Oregon) | us-west-2 |
| AWS GovCloud (US-West) | us-gov-west-1 |
| Asia Pacific (Tokyo) | ap-northeast-1 |
| Asia Pacific (Seoul) | ap-northeast-2 |
| Asia Pacific (Mumbai) | ap-south-1 |
| Asia Pacific (Singapore) | ap-southeast-1 |
| Asia Pacific (Sydney) | ap-southeast-2 |
| Canada (Central) | ca-central-1 |
| Europe (Frankfurt) | eu-central-1 |
| Europe (Zurich) | eu-central-2 |
| Europe (Ireland) | eu-west-1 |
| Europe (London) | eu-west-2 |
| Europe (Paris) | eu-west-3 |
| South America (SÃ£o Paulo) | sa-east-1 |

For the most up-to-date information on region availability, refer to the [AWS Bedrock Supported Regions documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/batch-inference-supported.html).

## Batch Inference

AWS Bedrock batch inference enables you to process large volumes of inference requests asynchronously. This is particularly useful for scenarios where you need to generate responses for a large set of prompts without waiting for each response in real-time.

### Benefits of Batch Inference

1. **Cost-effective**: Batch inference offers a 50% discount compared to on-demand pricing
2. **High throughput**: Process thousands of requests in a single job
3. **Asynchronous processing**: Submit a job and retrieve results when processing is complete
4. **S3 integration**: Input and output data is stored in your S3 buckets
5. **Resource-efficient**: No need to maintain your own infrastructure for large-scale processing

### Supported Models and Regions

Not all models available for online processing support batch inference. The supported models vary by region. For the most current and accurate information, please refer to the [AWS Bedrock Batch Inference Supported Models](aws_bedrock_batch_model_availability.md) documentation.
